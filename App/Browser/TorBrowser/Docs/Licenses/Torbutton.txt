Subject: Re: ProxyButton licensing question

Hello Scott,

I'm glad to support your project so you can use the Proxybutton in any way you
need under any open source license as it's stated in mozdev's copyright policy.
I'll just ask you to put in the Tor or it's source code any credits with
references to me and the original Proxybutton.  Feel free to ask if you have
any questions regarding the extension - I'll be glad to help you.
