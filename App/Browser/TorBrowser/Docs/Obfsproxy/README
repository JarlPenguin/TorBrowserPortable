Obfsproxy is a pluggable transport proxy written in Python.

See doc/HOWTO.txt for installation instructions.

If you want to write a pluggable transport, see the code of already
existing transports in obfsproxy/transports/ . Unfortunately a coding
guide for pluggable transport authors does not exist at the moment!
